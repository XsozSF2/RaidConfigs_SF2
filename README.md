# RaidConfigs_SF2

Public raid configs respository for the game shadow fight 2. If you don't know how to use these files, they will be useless for you.

# DIRECTORIES:
  1) master - unity configs, ever produced by developers
  2) master__1.9.38 - some modded raid configs for the leaked mod "Open Raids 1.9.38" of Hacker Pashtet. Can be installed by pasting into the "raid_configs" folder one of the econfig.zip with changing permissions to r-xr-xr-x (read & execute)
